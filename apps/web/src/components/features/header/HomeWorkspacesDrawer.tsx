/**
 * The mobile "catch up" drawer — opened by LONG-PRESSING Home in the footer
 * (v3's replacement for v2's always-visible workspace rail, which paid a
 * permanent strip of screen for an occasional job).
 *
 * TWO ZONES with deliberately different anatomy, so the two jobs never compete
 * (nested workspace-rows + channel-rows always read as mush):
 *
 *  - A horizontal STRIP of workspace logos on top — v2's rail rotated sideways
 *    and summoned on demand. Tap switches workspace; a dot marks workspaces
 *    with unreads; the current one is ringed. Works when everything is read.
 *  - A LIST of unread channels beneath, full-width rows in the sidebar idiom,
 *    grouped under plain-text workspace names (headers are labels, not rows —
 *    nothing competes with the channel rows for tap weight).
 *
 * Muted channels are excluded, matching every other unread aggregate (the Home
 * dot that advertises this drawer among them).
 */
/**
 * Shared open state: the footer's Home long-press AND the channel sidebar's
 * workspace switcher (mobile) both open the same drawer instance, which lives
 * in AppMobileFooter — mounted on every mobile page either trigger exists on.
