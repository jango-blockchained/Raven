 * EXPERIMENT — iOS-style stacked photos.
 *
 * Instead of a grid/carousel, a group of images is rendered as a small pile of
 * cards: the NEWEST image on top with a hint of tilt (each photo dealt onto the
 * pile), the older ones beneath peeking out with seeded offset + rotation and
 * their own shadow, like a stack of physical photos. On hover the pile fans open
 * a touch. Clicking opens the existing viewer at the top (newest) image — the
 * rest are reachable from there as before.
 *
 * On MOBILE the pile relaxes into an Instagram-style vertical run: each card
 * sits below the previous one with a MOBILE_OVERLAP seam, keeping the tilt and
 * a hint of sideways jitter — vertical space is cheap on a phone, horizontal
 * isn't, and there's no hover to fan the pile open.
 *
 * The container's size is derived from the cards' stored dimensions (responsive
 * width by breakpoint + a bounding-box aspect ratio), so message heights are
 * deterministic — no resize after paint, no DOM measurement. Only the first four
 * images are drawn; a badge counts the rest.
