/**
 * Mirrors the unread total onto the app icon via the Badging API — iOS 16.4+
 * installed PWAs, Android and desktop Chromium; a silent no-op everywhere else.
 *
 * This covers the APP-RUNNING case only (the stores are live and reconcile reads
 * made on other devices). While the app is closed, sw.js sets the badge: it
 * supports an authoritative `unread_count` from the push payload, but the server
 * doesn't send one yet (TODO, server-side), so in practice the SW uses its
 * fallback — the count of displayed notifications. The two definitions differ,
 * which is fine while asleep; on every return to the app the resume re-sync
 * below re-imposes this hook's definition. Remaining gap: reading on desktop
 * with NO subsequent push leaves the badge stale until the next open — the same
 * trade WhatsApp ships; closing it needs badge-only pushes on read events
 * (Declarative Web Push, iOS 18.4+), which is server-side work.
