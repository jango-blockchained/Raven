 * unread filter applies to rows entering the view, not ones already displayed —
 * so rows seen unread are remembered in `keepIds` and survive the filter
 * (rendered as read). But a row the user has DEALT WITH must not stay forever
 * either: once `shouldLeave` holds and it isn't the open row, it lingers
 * briefly, animates closed (`leavingIds` drives LeavingRow's collapse), and is
 * then dropped from `keepIds` so the filter removes it.
 *
 * Wiring (see useNotificationList / useThreadList):
 *   - hand `keepIds` to the row selector, and ADD ids seen unread during
 *     selection (the hook owns the set, the caller owns what enters it)
 *   - include `version` in the selection memo's deps — departures mutate the
 *     set, and the memo must recompute when they do
 *   - call `onRows(selected)` right after the memo
 *   - render rows in `leavingIds` collapsed (LeavingRow)
