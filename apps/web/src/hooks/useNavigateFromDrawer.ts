/**
 * Navigate out of a bottom drawer without the drawer haunting the iOS
 * back-swipe. Every drawer (or mobile sheet) that navigates somewhere must
 * route through this hook.
 *
 * Why it exists: the OS back-gesture animates with a screenshot taken around
 * the moment of navigation. Navigating while a drawer is still on screen
 * bakes the drawer into that screenshot, so a later back-swipe shows the
 * drawer "still open" (the full story lives on DRAWER_EXIT_MS and in
 * docs/pwa-enhancements.md #32). The fix is always the same: close the
 * drawer, wait out its exit animation, then navigate.
 *
 * `close` is called immediately. On mobile, navigation then waits for the
 * exit animation to finish. On desktop navigation is instant — there is no
 * back-swipe screenshot, and dialogs float over the page instead of covering
 * it.
 *
 * The destination can be a Promise (create a DM, create a thread). The server
 * round-trip then runs DURING the close animation instead of after it —
 * navigation fires when both are done. Resolve to null or undefined to cancel
 * the navigation (the caller shows its own error toast).
 *
 * `instant` skips the mobile wait — only for taps that land on the page
 * already sitting under the drawer, where a pause feels dead (see the
 * workspace-switch case in HomeWorkspacesDrawer).
